# My ML Journey 🚀

Welcome to my machine learning learning journey! I'm starting from scratch and sharing everything I build — from basic algorithms to real-world projects.

## 📍Current Topic: Decision Tree (Classification)

### 🔍 What is a Decision Tree?

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure used to make decisions. It splits data by asking yes/no questions to make predictions.

### ✅ What I Learned:
- Basics of supervised learning
- Classification using DecisionTreeClassifier from `sklearn`
- How to visualize and interpret a tree

### 🧠 Python Code
